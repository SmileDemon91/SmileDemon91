name: Carlos Enrique Ruiz Martinez

Profile:
  Description:
Hello, I’m Carlos Ruiz, a DevOps, SysOps,
and Cloud Engineer with solid experience
in managing and optimizing cloud platforms,
both in Azure and AWS. I currently work at
Santander Digital Services, where I manage
resources, implement automation, and ensure
the security and scalability of cloud solutions.
I’ve led key projects such as creating a CRM
to optimize customer service, a data lake for
advanced analysis, and implementing CMDBs
to organize resources in public clouds.

Additionally, I have over three years of
experience in migrating microservices to
OpenShift, leading an SRE team to ensure
efficient deployments and operational
continuity.

With certifications in AWS and experience
in automation, IaC, and tools like Terraform,
I have helped several organizations improve
their infrastructure, performance, and security.
My passion is working at the intersection
of technology and efficiency,
ensuring systems run optimally and securely
